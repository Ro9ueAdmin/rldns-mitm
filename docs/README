Rldns version 1.1 is free lightweight dns server software developed by www.ringlayer.net




INSTALLATION
To install rldns, just type : ./configure && make && make install





CONFIGURATION
Once installed, you may configure rldns.conf at /usr/local/rldns/rldns.conf. Each keyword(s) on rldns.conf:
- port keyword is used to specify dns server port
- worker keyword used to specify how many worker(s) will you use
- version keyword is mark of rldns version
- zones keyword used to specify path of zone files (should inside rldns directory)
- dns1 and dns2 keyword(s) are used to specify another dns server for rldns to dig, if no record found for a domain request
- resolvertype keyword to determine resolver type, suggested resolver type is 2 for best a name load balancing resolver performance
Below is an example of correct rldns.conf configuration:

;default rldns Configuration File
;use comma to put comment(s) 
;recommended setting with 2 or 3 workers
port 53
worker 1
version "RLDNS-1.1-MITM"
;all zone files must be on zones directory, otherwise it will be ignored
zones zones/*.zone
dns1 8.8.4.4
dns2 8.8.8.8
;a name resolver type can be 1 or 2 
;Resolver Type 1, if more than 1 ip address for a name to resolve, this will do a dns based load balancing without randomizing ip addresses (for a name request only)
;Resolver Type 2, if more than 1 ip address for a name request to resolve, this will randomize multiple ip sequences for dns based load balancing (for a name request only)
;By default, resolver type is 2 (suggested resolver type is 2 for best a name load balancing resolver performance)
resolvertype 2




ZONE FILES
Each zone file for each domain located at /usr/local/rldns/zones. A zone file for a domain must have .zone extension.
A zone file should starts with  keyword : "masterzone"  followed by a domain name. Format: masterzone <domain name>

A RECORD
Format :  Arecord  <ip address>
To add an A record, keyword "Arecord" must preceed an ip address.
Maximal A records for each domain is 18. To add a C name, use keyword:"CNAMErecord" followed by c name record for domain.

MX
Format: MXrecord <name>
To add MX, use keyword:"MXrecord" followed by mx record name.  

NS RECORD

- NSrecord <name>    
or 
- NSrecord <name> <ip address>
To add ns record, use keyword: "NSrecord" followed by name.

Below is example of correct zone file configuration for example1.com, note ! above configuration should be saved as example1.com.zone at /usr/local/rldns/zones folder
